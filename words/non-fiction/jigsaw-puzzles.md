# Jigsaw Puzzles

My parents have started building jigsaw puzzles again. They go through phases of building four or five puzzles and then taking a really long break. The last time they were on a building streak, they built a Wizard of Oz puzzle that had been sitting in storage for years. As far as Wizard of Oz, artwork goes, it was a pretty standard shot of Dorothy and her companions on the yellow brick road. The completed puzzle was memorialized and glued together using Mod Podge. It currently sits covered in a corner of a bedroom that we primarily use for storage.

We were doing some cleaning over the summer and found a series of puzzles that were purchased and never completed. One was a massive puzzle featuring painted artwork of cats on a couch, the other was a multi-pack of puzzles that look like they were photographs originally taken for postcards. None of these puzzles seemed like they would be too difficult to build, but each one had an unexpected challenge.

## Cats

This is what I would call a puzzle for enthusiasts. Opening the box revealed puzzle pieces that were untraditional in shape. Many pieces had a significant curve to them. Some of them looked like they would belong on an edge until we double checked the picture on the box and were reminded, that yes, this puzzle is supposed to be rectangular.

The difficulty of this puzzle was deceiving. My parents thought that the unusual pieces would make things easier, but the finer details of the puzzle started to blend together. Each of the seven cats featured had a distinct fur pattern, but when broken down into small pieces, noting the difference in fur colors was just not working. A paw with white looked like it could have gone in multiple spots despite the unique appearance of the pieces.

The work in progress spread across the kitchen table made it look like they were working on four smaller puzzles. They were attempting to build each cat individually and combine them at the end. My parents even got a second poster board out to have even more space to work with. For a couple of weeks, they were carefully transporting the poster boards from the kitchen table back to their bedroom so that there would be space to eat dinner.

Eventually, the puzzle started to come together. The cats were safely transferred from one poster board to another. All that was left to do was fill in the last handful of pieces. Each piece brought more agony as it was becoming obvious that although there were no more puzzles pieces, there was still an empty spot in the puzzle. In the end, one single piece was missing which contained a small bit of a cat's tail.

We began looking around for the missing puzzle piece. There was nothing obvious on the table or the floor. The puzzle box was completely empty. The kitchen table is very heavy to move, but we poked around underneath it and felt nothing. The missing piece still has not been found. The puzzle was put back in its box.

## Gondolas

The next few puzzles were part of a multi-pack. The first puzzle that my parents attempted was a photograph of Times Square in New York. Suspiciously, there was also a piece missing from this puzzle that was eventually found underneath their bed when I was vacuuming their room. The next puzzle they tried looked like it was going to be difficult right from the start. It featured a series on gondolas in front of a church in Venice, Italy. There were many shades of blue.

My parents start building jigsaw puzzles with the solid strategy of building the edges first. My mom was really struggling with this one. The outline of the puzzle was nearly complete, but there was a connected series of ten edge pieces off to the side of the table. The puzzle was also in the wrong orientation and was shaped like a portrait shot instead of a landscape photo.

Pieces were connecting to different pieces of the puzzle without any problems. This posed a problem when the color between the pieces was indistinguishable. I can't tell if this was a result of the puzzle being intentionally difficult or just bad quality control from the manufacturer. The same problem happened multiple times. My mom nearly gave up on the puzzle.

My dad and I were still determined to complete the puzzle. The area of the puzzle containing gondolas looked slightly off when compared to the picture on the box. We had never seen a jigsaw puzzle that could be reconstructed with a different outcome, or more specifically, an incorrect outcome, but I guess it is possible. It has been a month since my parents have attempted a jigsaw puzzle.
