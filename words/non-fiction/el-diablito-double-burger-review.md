# El Diablito Double Burger Review

There are plenty of reasons why the Angels season was torture this year. The dread that Shohei Ohtani could have been traded at the trade deadline, the resulting disappointment from the playoff push, Aaron Loup casually blowing leads and so many injuries. Time and time again we were reminded by Bally Sports that this game we call life can be incredibly hard. One thing that often got ignored in daily Angels baseball discussions was a new advertising campaign from Carl's Jr. Getting bombarded by Carl's Jr. commercials is a pretty typical television viewing experience so maybe that's why the new campaign flew under the radar, but a new change made the commercials stick out. Each commercial would have the iconic star shout "YEAH". It is very difficult to tune out and it felt like it was played during each commercial break, sometimes multiple times in the same break. The menu item may have changed, but the obnoxious shouting continued. If I had to make a conservative estimate, Carl's Jr. would probably run at least 10 commercials a game. I watched as many Angels games as I could this season to experience what may be Ohtani's last season with the team which has probably resulted in me hearing "YEAH" being repeated at least a thousand times. Eventually, it happened, I went to Carl's Jr to try the El Diablito double burger.

Carl's Jr. really wanted to crank up the heat this summer, but given the all time high temperatures experienced across the country this year, they didn't have to try very hard. The El Diablito double burger, which translates to English literally as "the little devil", is a smaller and economical alternative to the El Diablo burger. The commercials would switch between advertising these two burgers. The El Diablo burger was making a triumphant return after being removed from the menu in 2018. This burger is topped with bacon, habanero sauce, jalapenos and even jalapeno poppers. Trying to order one can be a bit confusing. As with other items on the menu, you can upgrade the burger to a double which includes two patties or go even further and upgrade it to be served using all angus beef. The commercials boast that you could save money by ordering through the restaurant's app and get the burger for a fitting price of $6.66, but that only applies to the basic offering. To get the best that Carl's Jr. offers, you are looking at near restaurant prices for a meal. Luckily, the El Diablito double burger provides a real deal.

The El Diablito double burger simplifies things by only adding jalapenos and habanero sauce. Without those ingredients, the burger would be very bare-bones. It is always a risk figuring out whether or not a restaurant will deliver on its promise of actually adding enough of a special ingredient to taste it, but Carl's Jr. did. Every bite of this burger had plenty of jalapeno. I was surprised and fearful. I do not handle spicy food very well, but I have been trying to up my spice tolerance to be in solidarity with the celebrities that go on Hot Ones. With enough Hi-C fruit punch and water, I eventually ate the entire burger. If the burger was any bigger, I think it would have been very tedious to eat. I probably would not be able to handle eating the real El Diablo burger in one sitting. The heat level here was not too extreme, but I could definitely feel the spice which kept adding up with each bite.

I would like to see some figures on how much Carl's Jr. is spending on jalapenos. If every burger had the same amount of toppings each time, I could see why the El Diablo burger got discontinued. The commercials made it clear that the return was for a limited time only. Maybe Carl's Jr. will adopt the McRib strategy and only bring back the sandwiches when the costs are low enough. Originally, I was going to skip out on these burgers, but the commercials started getting more distressing and saying that I was running out of time to try them. When I thought the campaign was coming to an end and I would finally be free of the barrage of "YEAH" shouts, Carl's Jr. repurposed the template of these commercials to promote the new Big Char Chile Burger. The commercials claim that this new burger has an anaheim chili, which seems somewhat appropriate to promote while watching baseball games being played in Anaheim, California. Overall, it is hard for me to get excited about limited time food unless I know it will make a return like Thanksgiving turkey. If there is one thing that I have learned from all of this is that the Carl's Jr. app does have some great deals and maybe that is what these commercials are actually not so subtly advertising.
