# El Diablito Double Burger Review

There are plenty of reasons why the Angels season was torture this year. The dread that Shohei Ohtani could have been traded at the trade deadline, the resulting disappointment from the playoff push, Aaron Loup casually blowing leads and so many injuries. Time and time again we were reminded by Bally Sports that this game we call life can be incredibly hard. One thing that often got ignored in daily Angels baseball discussions was a new advertising campaign from Carl's Jr. Getting bombarded by Carl's Jr. commercials is a pretty typical television viewing experience so maybe that's why the new campaign flew under the radar, but a new change made the commercials stick out. Each commercial would have the iconic star shout "YEAH". It is very difficult to tune out and it felt like it was played during each commercial break, sometimes multiple times in the same break. The menu item may have changed, but the obnoxious shouting continued. If I had to make a conservative estimate, Carl's Jr. would probably run at least 10 commercials a game. I watched as many Angels games as I could this season to experience what may be Ohtani's last season with the team which has probably resulted in me hearing "YEAH" being repeated at least a thousand times. Eventually, it happened, I went to Carl's Jr to try the El Diablito double burger.
