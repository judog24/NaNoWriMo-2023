# Socks

## Chapter 1

He had always heard about the urban legend of losing socks on laundry day, but he had never witnessed it himself. Where did they go? Did dryers heat socks up so much that they fall apart and land in the lint filter? Did it all happen in the final act of removing clothes from the dryer and socks falling into a place that is talked about but rarely seen, "under the dryer". Who knows what riches could be found under there. It's a place as mythical as searching under the sofa.

He kept a simple assortment of white socks. It simplified laundry day. He figured that a red sock cannot ruin his clothes if he didn't own any. On birthdays and Christmas, he would occasionally receive some fancy socks that featured artwork from his favorite television shows, but those just kept slowly occupying a spot in the corner of his sock drawer.

Even with plain socks removing the tedious process of finding a matching pair, getting his sock drawer organized was still annoying. He could simply lay his crew socks flat, but it looked sloppy and made the drawer hard to close as they overflowed slightly. Folding socks was awkward. Folding socks in half created an awkward shape with the heel sticking out. Rolling socks together really maximizes space in a suitcase but he was worried that it would damage his socks if he stored them that way. Despite having socks that were easily replaceable, he hated shopping for new socks.

It was a trip that he was hoping to avoid, but the material in the heel of too many of his socks was wearing thin. No holes were visible, but there was a lack of cushion that was noticeable as he walked around the house without shoes.

## Chapter 2

The sock aisle at the store, as small as it was sure had a lot of options. Perhaps too many. Six packs, twelve packs, cushioned, performance, extra cushion, there always seemed like there something new in sock technology. Did things really change? He wondered why sock manufacturers didn't just sell single pairs of socks to give everything a try.
