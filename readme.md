# NaNoWriMo 2023

This is my attempt at completing NaNoWriMo 2023. The goal is to write 50,000 words in one month. Typically, the goal is to write a novel, but I try to write various forms of content. My attempts each year have followed a theme, but this year, I do not have anything planned out.

- 2020: Movie Reviews
- 2021: Video Games
- 2022: Memoirs/short stories
- 2023: ???

Let's see how close I get this year. 2020 got derailed quick. 2021 went somewhat better. 2022 produced some content, but I never made it public. Viewing my work in progress is back this year.

This year will probably be a mess, but I think that is to be expected with most NaNoWriMo projects. Words! Content!

## Word count

|  Day |  Words (Total) |
|  --- |   ---  |
|   1  |   250  |
|   2  |   800  |
|      |        |

## Progress

### Day 1/2

Did some late night writing when the clock hit midnight just to get some words in. Busy couple of days. Attempted to write a food review.
