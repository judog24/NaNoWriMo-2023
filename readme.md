# NaNoWriMo 2023

This is my attempt at completing NaNoWriMo 2023. The goal is to write 50,000 words in one month. Typically, the goal is to write a novel, but I try to write various forms of content. My attempts each year have followed a theme, but this year, I do not have anything planned out.

- 2020: Movie Reviews
- 2021: Video Games
- 2022: Memoirs/short stories
- 2023: ???

Let's see how close I get this year. 2020 got derailed quick. 2021 went somewhat better. 2022 produced some content, but I never made it public. Viewing my work in progress is back this year.

This year will probably be a mess, but I think that is to be expected with most NaNoWriMo projects. Words! Content!

## Word count

|  Day |  Words (Total) |
|  --- |   ---  |
|   1  |   250  |
|   2  |   800  |
|   3  |  2000  |
|   10 |  2630  |
|   13 |  3380  |

## Progress

### Day 1/2

Did some late night writing when the clock hit midnight just to get some words in. Busy couple of days. Attempted to write a food review.

### Day 3

Wrote about some jigsaw puzzles that my parents were working on.

A word sprint led to the start of a fictional short story that seems very mundane, but I have an idea for a twist. This is my first attempt at fictional writing during any NaNoWriMo attempt.

### Day 10

There are probably some questions about where the other days went, but that will be answered in a story soon enough. I did not have rib injury on my list of reasons that would prevent me from completing NaNoWriMo.

Finally writing some words again. I doubt I'll reach the end goal, but I still want to make it a point to write as much as I can. Began writing about my time on Mastodon.

### Day 13

Trying to get back into the habit of writing. Brought out my laptop to do some writing while watching late night TV. Wrote around 750 words about the new When We Were Young news. I never published it anywhere, but writing about my experience at When We Were Young last year did take up a large chunk of my NaNoWriMo word count.
